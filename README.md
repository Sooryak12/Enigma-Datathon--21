# Enigma-Datathon--21

Engima Datathon is Machine Learning Competition conducted by NMIMS Indore and I won 3rd Position in it.

It comprised of 3 rounds with around 55 Teams all over India .It was thrilling and exhausting as it was a 24 hour hackathon and the last round was from 3 am -7 am.
First Round was about building an classifier model for a Tabular Data and Second round was to detect whether an company gave a timely response to a complaint .It was about using both NLP and Tabular data to get Good results.
Third round was my favorite round where we have to perform Exploratory Data Analysis on a given data and present it to Judges.
